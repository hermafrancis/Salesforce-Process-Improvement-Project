# Salesforce-Process-Improvement-Project
This project was built during a Business Analyst/Admin Team Sprint hosted by Clicked, an E-Learning provider. I formed part of a team of Salesforce Consultants tasked with the responsibility of improving the internal process to secure sponsors for the TrailblazerDX conference hosted by Salesforce.
